# zzz â€“ sleep computer

Feeling tired? Why not stay up and hack together a machine to help you experience [lucid dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream).

![zzz in operation](https://github.com/mirthturtle/zzz/blob/main/bedside.jpg "zzz in operation")

`zzz` uses a trigger-style mouse to play distinctive sounds. Wear it during sleep and test your reality in dreams by squeezing your finger or thumb. If you hear the sounds, you can recognize that you're asleep and take control of the dream.

## Equipment

You will need:
- A [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/)
- An ergonomic handheld trigger mouse
- Speaker or headphones

## Setup

Clone the repo to your Pi. Install Python:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```
Install dependencies:
```
pip3 install pygame evdev
```
Depending on your Pi OS version you may need to add `--break-system-packages` here; this is fine if your Pi will be a dedicated `zzz` machine and you don't care about your Python environment; otherwise, create a virtual environment.

Put sounds in the `sound` directory and link them to your desired buttons in `zzz.py`.

## Running

Run with: `sh run.sh`.
